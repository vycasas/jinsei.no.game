Jinsei no Game (Game of Life)

About:
This is a small project written in Haskell demostrating Conway's Game of Life. 
It is pretty basic, but a very good learning experience. It currently 
demonstrates the Pulsar pattern, but you can change the initial configuration 
in the Main.hs.

Building:
This project uses Cabal. If you have the Haskell platform in your system, then 
you can build the project by executing:

> cabal build

The output will be in the "dist" directory.

TODO:
* Process command line arguments for inputs like initial grid states.
